## Reflection

This repository is created for the development of a technical test requested by the Wompi company, where the functionality was left to the developer's imagination ;).

One of the main challenges I encountered was time. Due to the time limitations of the project, I had to carry out each point of the technical test, leaving an opportunity for improvement in each of these.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use `npx microfrontend-create` a library where I am a co-creator, in `webpack.config.js` you can better understand the build process.
